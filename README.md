# Blazor Carrera&reg; Digital Prototype

This prototype implements a small example to access the Carrera Digital Control Unit via Blazor. 

Apart from the self written code, it uses the following components:

* ASP.NET Core Blazor
* [Blazm.Bluetooth](https://github.com/EngstromJimmy/Blazm.Bluetooth) from [EngstromJimmy](https://github.com/EngstromJimmy)
* [QuickGrid](https://github.com/aspnet/AspLabs/tree/main/src/QuickGrid) from the [AspLabs](https://github.com/aspnet/AspLabs) 

`Blazm.Bluetooth` is a Web Bluetooth API abstraction for Blazor. This prototype should work more or less reliable in Microsoft Edge. Other browsers have not been tested.

The following pages and repositories served as resources to understand the Carrera Digital Protocol:

* [Lap counter protocol](http://slotbaer.de/carrera-digital-124-132/10-cu-rundenzaehler-protokoll.html) by Slotbaer (german)
* [Python carreralib](https://github.com/tkem/carreralib/tree/master/carreralib) by [tkem](https://github.com/tkem) 

Give it try, if you own a Carrera Digital slot car track!
